# SVM (Scala Virtual Machine)


## Introduction
![Overview] (./overview.jpg)
The project is to implement a virtual machine which runs bytecode instructions, and an interperter that accepts code in functional & imperative languages & bytecode as well based on the virtual machine. That means, all the code in functional or imperative languages are first compiled to bytecode and then executed.


## Current Progress
1. Functional Language:
    * 
2. Impretaive Language:
    * 
3. Bytecode:
    * 

## Future Plans
TBD...

\* The project was first written for CS653 class at USFCA.
